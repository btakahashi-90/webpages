# Hero Siege Relic Planner
## OUTDATED INFORMATION - I no longer play the game as of 2022

External Requirements (already in code):

[jQuery 3.6.0 Core](https://releases.jquery.com/jquery/)

Purpose:

Assist gamers in planning their Relics for Hero Siege. Now really just a practice/reference file.

Features:
- Filters for Description and Stats. They should work together for more precise filtering.
- Maximum Relic count - so you don't accidentally add more relics than your character can have.
- Stat increase calculations to help with optimization of your build.

Improvements that can/should be made:
- Create a way to Import relics for easier updating (I.E. with a JSON file).
- Create an Export for future reference/use of previously created builds.
- Auto-optimization based on class (would be preference based for stats, dealers choice on how to implement).
- Approximate damage/survivability calculations based on stat increases (good luck).

Other possible uses:
- Can be modified for use in just about any game that has equipment.
