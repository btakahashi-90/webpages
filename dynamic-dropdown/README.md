Dynamic Dropdowns using JS and JQUERY.

External Requirements (already in code):
[jQuery 3.6.0 Core](https://releases.jquery.com/jquery/)

Purpose:
A simplified webpage to show one way to create "Dynamic Dropdowns" - a method of displaying different information on a webpage
based on selections from dropdowns.

In this example multiple different dropdown elements are used for the following:
-The first dropdown element will determine what is displayed in the "middle column", which is another dropdown element.
-The second dropdown element will determine the information displayed on the far right as well as modify
the behavior of the button (a simple Google search), also far right.
-The information provided underneath the first dropdown element is for simple "debugging", providing information on which
options are selected from each dropdown element.

This is not intended to be used "as-is", anyone using this code should modify it to accommodate their needs including, but not limited to:
-Changing HTML element values (name, id, etc)
-Changing how the "Google Stuff" button functions (it currently builds a URL based on an HTML data attribute)
-Adding and utilizing JS variables for cleaner code
-Styling the HTML further
